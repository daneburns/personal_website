# My Personal Website

_i.e. an excuse to write something in Elm for the first time_

This is an attempt at using Elm, alongside the newly launched elm-land framework, to rebuild my personal website this year.

I love FP on the back end, want to see what it's like writing front ends using a **strongly** typed, reactive, pure(?) FP language like Elm.
